# Nonograms Game 🧩

## 📌 Task Description
This project is an implementation of the **Nonograms** task from the Rolling Scopes School curriculum.

https://github.com/rolling-scopes-school/tasks/tree/master/tasks/nonograms

The goal of the task was to create a browser-based logic puzzle game (**Nonograms / Picross**) strictly following the provided technical specification (TS), without using external libraries or frameworks.

---

## 🧠 Game Overview
**Nonograms** is a logic puzzle where the player reveals a hidden picture by filling in cells on a grid according to numeric clues.

Game rules:
- Numbers next to rows and columns indicate groups of filled cells.
- Groups are separated by at least one empty cell.
- The player must logically deduce which cells should be filled or left empty.
- When all clues are satisfied, the picture is revealed.

## ✅ Task Completion
- ✔ Task **fully completed**
- ✔ Implemented **strictly according to the technical specification**
- ✔ All logic implemented **independently**
- ✔ No external libraries or frameworks used
- ✔ No copied or template solutions
- ✔ Full game logic written in **Vanilla JavaScript**

## 🛠 Technologies Used
- **HTML5** — semantic markup
- **CSS3** — grid layout, visual states, UI styling
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)** — game logic, puzzle validation, event handling
- **ESLint** — code quality and consistency

---
